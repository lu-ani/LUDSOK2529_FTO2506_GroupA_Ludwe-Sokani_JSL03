# JSL03 Project Brief: Console-Based Task Manager

Challange 3 from the Codespace Javascript Language (JSL) course. The challange is to update the existing codebase to take user inputs and include them in an existing array as an object. There checks that need to be passed for the users object to be valid and also a limit to how many objects a user can add. Once the user is done, the information should be logged into the console, showing all the tasks and also those which are completed.


## Key Objectives
Logic & User Interaction:

<li> Store tasks as objects inside an array for structured data management.
<li> Allow users to add up to three new tasks to the existing task list.
<li> Ensure each new task has a unique incremental ID based on the last task in the array.
<li> Prompt users to enter task details (title, description, status) and store them in an object.
<li> Alert users when they reach the task limit with the message: "There are enough tasks on your board, please check them in the console." Implement a filter function to display only tasks with the status "done".
<li> Log all tasks in the console with a clear label for easy review.
<li> Log only completed tasks (status: "done") in the console under a "Completed Tasks" label for quick reference.
