# JSL03 Project Brief: Console-Based Task Manager

## Key Objectives
Logic & User Interaction:

<li> Store tasks as objects inside an array for structured data management.
<li> Allow users to add up to three new tasks to the existing task list.
<li> Ensure each new task has a unique incremental ID based on the last task in the array.
<li> Prompt users to enter task details (title, description, status) and store them in an object.
<li> Alert users when they reach the task limit with the message: "There are enough tasks on your board, please check them in the console." Implement a filter function to display only tasks with the status "done".
<li> Log all tasks in the console with a clear label for easy review.
<li> Log only completed tasks (status: "done") in the console under a "Completed Tasks" label for quick reference.
